This was uploaded from the old im.lternet.edu website and is probably out of date.

Comments from the old webpage:
This is the latest release of the Esri to EML XSLT. It has some inherent shortcomings -- 
ESRI, ISO and FGDC are less granular than EML is the "personnel" section (origin/creator, contact, etc). Also, some customizations need to be done for your particular organization or site. Please read the project documentation. This applies for ESRI version 10 to EML2.1.0
